# Case-cohort interval-censored data with time-dependent covariates
This SAS macro can be applied to interval-censored data with time-dependent covariates in case-cohort design. 
The work is built upon Sparling's SAS macro PARM_ICE.SAS (Version 3.2). By specifying a positive number (no greater than 1) after argument "prob=", user can indicate the sampling weight for a case-cohort design. 
For details of other parameters, we recommend users refer to Sparling's SAS macro documentation.
